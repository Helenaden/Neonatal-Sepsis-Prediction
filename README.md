# Neonatal-Sepsis-Prediction

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

Neonatal sepsis is a significant cause of neonatal death and has been a major challenge worldwide. The difficulty in early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis leads to delay in treatment. The early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis has been predicted to improve neonatal outcomes. The use of machine learning techniques with the relevant screening parameters provides new ways of understanding neonatal sepsis and having possible solutions to tackle the challenges it presents.

PROPOSED SOLUTION

This work proposes an algorithm for predicting neonatal sepsis using electronic medical record (EMR) data from Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) that can improve the early recognition and treatment of sepsis in neonates. The proposed algorithm implements Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), and Decision tree (DT) algorithms.

RESULTS

The results of this study show that the proposed algorithm outperformed the physician diagnosis. The study provides evidence that the combination of maternal risk factors, neonatal clinical signs, and laboratory tests effectively diagnose neonatal sepsis.
